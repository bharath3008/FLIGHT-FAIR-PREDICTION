## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

## Problem Statement

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities. Size of training set: 10683 records

* Size of test set: 2671 records
* FEATURES: Airline: The name of the airline.
* Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey
* Source: The source from which the service begins.
* Destination: The destination where the service ends.
* Route: The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.
* Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.
* Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.
* Duration: Total duration of the flight.
* Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination.
* Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight
* Price: The price of the ticket

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Productionization

In this step, I built a flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver. The API endpoint takes in a request with a list of values from a flight and returns an estimated price.


## Future Scope

* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Front-End
